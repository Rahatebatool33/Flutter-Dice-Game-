## 🛠 Tech Stack & Concepts Used

- **Flutter & Dart** – for building UI and app logic  
- **StatefulWidget & setState** – to manage dynamic changes (dice roll, score, messages)  
- **AnimationController & Tween** – for dice rotation and bounce animations  
- **Confetti package** – for celebratory confetti effects on jackpots  
- **Widgets Used**:  
  - `Scaffold` – main layout container  
  - `Container` – for gradient background and styling  
  - `Column` & `SizedBox` – layout and spacing  
  - `Text` – dynamic messages and score display  
  - `Image.asset` – displaying dice images  
  - `ElevatedButton` – ROLL DICE / RESTART actions  
- **Random class** – to generate dice numbers (1–6)  
- **MediaQuery** – for responsive full-screen layout  
- **SafeArea** – avoids notches/status bars  
- **Stack** – for layering confetti above UI elements  

This project demonstrates **animation, UI design, state management, and interactivity** in Flutter.
